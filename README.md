# FakeRealEstateWebsite
Designed and developed as a personal side project by Madison Liddell.

Runs on Asp.net MVC 4 using a MySQL database in ASPX (C#). The goal was to learn and practice with the Asp.net MVC framework. The database data is completely fabricated but the site provides working access to it with search functionality. 

The site is overall still a work in progress so not all functionalities are fully working or implemented yet but are detailed below.

# Goals
- [complete] Search and view Agents (database entity) by name or location 
- [+] Search and view Properties (entity) 
- [+] Schedule appointments with Agents using Twilio API 
- [+] Authenticated users can modify database by adding, removing, or editing the data
